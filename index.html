        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description">
          The goal of this project was to develop a mobile task-management
          application (TODO app) with integrated features for user registration
          and authentication. React Navigation will be used for screen
          navigation within the application, and React Native will be used for
          cross-platform development. Furthermore, AsyncStorage will be used to
          store user login data persistently.

        <h4>Skills/Technologies Used</h4>
        <ul class="description">
          <li>
            - React Native: Used in the development of the mobile cross-platform
            application.
          </li>
          <li>
            - React Navigation: Used to control screen navigation, navigating
            between the TODO app, the Login Screen, and the Registration Screen
            with the help of Stack Navigator.
          </li>
          <li>
            - React Native Elements: These elements are used to create UI
            elements with a consistent and beautiful look, like buttons and
            input fields.
          </li>
          <li>
            - AsyncStorage: This feature allows users to safely log in and
            register by permanently storing their login credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Regular Expressions (RegEx): Used for input validation, this tool
            makes sure that data entered by users corresponds to the necessary
            patterns for first and last names, ZIP codes, phone numbers, emails,
            and passwords.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h4>Problems and Solutions</h4>
        <p class="description">
          Using regular expressions to handle input validation for different
          user inputs, like phone numbers, emails, and passwords, was one of the
          challenges faced during the development process. I used a variety of
          RegEx patterns to evaluate each input field according to its unique
          requirements in order to overcome this difficulty. For instance, I
          used a RegEx pattern to validate phone numbers to make sure the format
          matches "(xxx) xxx-xxxx" and that the number is made up only of
          digits. Similar to this, I used a sophisticated RegEx pattern to
          validate emails to make sure the prefix "@" and at least one period
          were present. Furthermore, I used input event handlers or blur event
          handlers to initiate input validation as soon as the user moves away
          from the input field or types, giving them instant feedback on the
          accuracy of their inputs. In addition, I included error messages that
          begin with "Error:" to let users know when their inputs don't match
          the necessary requirements. These messages vanish as soon as the
          mistake is fixed. I was able to create strong input validation for the
          registration screen and guarantee that customers submit accurate
          information by skillfully utilizing regular expressions and event
          handling techniques.

        <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
        <p class="description">
          In my web designs, I use a color scheme of greys and whites to convey
          a feeling of aesthetic refinement, minimalism, and cleanliness. The
          subdued color palette creates a calm background that lets the content
          shine through without being overshadowed. The design achieves a
          timeless elegance by embracing simplicity, which appeals to current
          sensibilities while guaranteeing clarity and ease of use. The careful
          application of these colors produces a visually pleasing effect that
          gives the digital area a feeling of peace and sophistication.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description">
          The goal of this project was to use React Native to create a basic
          mobile exercise monitoring application with distinct displays for
          different types of exercise. With features to raise, reset, and switch
          between exercises, the application lets users track both duration- and
          repetition-based workouts.

      <div class="section">
        <h4>Problems and Solutions</h4>
        <p class="description">
          During the development phase, one of the challenges was to ensure
          consistency and ease of navigation while moving workout data between
          screens in an efficient manner. I took a centralized approach to this
          by keeping a variety of exercises in the state of the Home screen
          component. Every piece of exercise-related data, such as its type,
          name, count/duration, and navigation options, is contained in this
          array. I made sure that every workout screen has access to the
          pertinent exercise data by providing this array as a parameter. I also
          used navigation parameters to control user inputs, such beginning the
          timer or increasing the count, and to dynamically show exercise
          specifics. Furthermore, I made use of React navigating's stack
          navigator feature to facilitate smooth navigating between exercises
          and back to the Home screen. This ensured an intuitive user experience
          throughout the program by enabling users to switch between workouts
          using both the buttons given inside each exercise screen and the back
          button on the device.

        <h4>Problems and Solutions</h4>
        <p class="description">
          Implementing the quiz's scoring mechanism and showing the right
          answers on the summary screen presented a problem during the
          development process. I took great care when creating the data
          structure for each question so that it would contain both the user's
          chosen answer and the correct answer or answers. When I got to the
          summary screen, I went over each question again and increased the
          score for each right response by comparing the user's chosen response
          with the correct response. Additionally, I styled the display to show
          whether the user's response was right or wrong by bolding the right
          answers and crossing out the incorrect ones. I used conditional
          rendering to add styles dynamically to the user's selected choices
          based on accuracy in order to do this. In order to compare the
          user-selected responses with the right ones and calculate the final
          score, I also employed array manipulation techniques. I overcame the
          difficulty and produced a workable quiz application that gives users
          performance feedback by carefully planning the data structure and
          putting in place the necessary logic for scoring and answer
          presentation.

          Making sure the alternate design offered a new look while maintaining
          user-friendliness and clarity posed a difficulty during the redesign
          process. In order to solve this, I carefully examined the functioning

          to get around this obstacle. My goal was to create a design that will
          increase user flow and interactivity in addition to aesthetics.
          Through iterative refinement of multiple design approaches and peer
